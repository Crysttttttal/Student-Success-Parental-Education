# Student-Success & Parental-Education
# STAT201-Group-Project_29

## Introduction

Examining the factors impacting academic grades is essential for comprehending educational achievements and tackling disparities. This repository presents a research endeavor centered on exploring how students' academic achievements relate to their parents' educational background.

### Background

Numerous research investigations have emphasized the link between the educational level of parents and the academic accomplishments of students, which can influence graduation rates and mirror educational disparities. This project employs a dataset sourced from the University of California, Irvine (UCI), encompassing 31 variables concerning the academic performance of 145 students, with a specific focus on parental attributes.

### Significance

The purpose of this analysis is to provide insight into how parental education levels influence student GPA, thereby contributing to the broader discourse on educational policies and the role of family involvement in academic achievement.

## Methods

We categorized students into two groups: those from high-education families and those from low-education families, based on whether at least one parent holds a university degree. We defined academic success as achieving a GPA above 3.0. Our hypotheses for the statistical test are:

```latex
H_0: p_h - p_l = 0
H_A: p_h - p_l â‰  0
